# Anomaly Detection in ICU Patient Monitoring

> A two-part data science project that explores interpretable and real-time approaches to anomaly detection in ICU vital signs.

---

## Overview

This repository documents the development of two machine learning systems for ICU patient monitoring — one using **classic time-series forecasting** and the other built for **real-time anomaly detection** with Kafka and unsupervised ML models.

Created across two graduate-level courses at Harvard University, these projects highlight how healthcare ML systems can evolve from transparent statistical modeling to scalable streaming applications.

##  Project Modules

### 1. [`legacy_stats_model/`](./legacy_stats_model/)
**Title**: _Interpretable Time-Series Modeling with ARIMA & ETS_

- Detects anomalies in systolic blood pressure (SysBP) and pulse
- Uses ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing to define confidence-based anomaly bounds
- Focuses on transparency and explainability for clinical decision-making


---

### 2. [`kafka_streaming_model/`](./kafka_streaming_model/)
**Title**: _Real-Time ICU Anomaly Detection with Kafka + Unsupervised ML_

- Simulates live data streams using Kafka
- Detects anomalies using Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM
- Uses SHAP for explainability and clustering for patient similarity insights

---

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - ICU Patient Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ukveteran/icu-patients)
- **Size**: 200 rows × 9 features
- **Key Features**:
  - `SysBP`: Systolic Blood Pressure
  - `Pulse`: Heart rate
  - `Survive`: Survival outcome (binary)
  - `Infection`: Infection presence (e.g., MRSA/sepsis)
  - `Emergency`: Emergency admission flag

> Note: The dataset is fully clean and ideal for small-scale clinical prototyping.

## Use Case

These models could be deployed as clinical decision support tools to:
- Alert ICU staff to early signs of instability
- Enable remote patient monitoring with interpretable alerts
- Serve as educational tools for explainable healthcare AI

## Installation 
Clone the repo and install dependencies 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/roshijay/Anomaly-Detection-in-ICU.git
cd Anomaly-Detection-in-ICU
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---
# How to Run 
- 1. Run the legacy Staistical Model( ARIMA/ETS)
     ```bash
     cd legacy_stats_model
     jupyter notebook legacy_model.ipynb  # or run legacy_model.py
     ```

- 2. Run the Kafka streaming Model(Real-Time)
     Terminal 1: Start Kafka producer (simulate patient data)
     ```bash 
     cd kafka_streaming_model/producer
     python stream_producer.py
     ```

     Terminal 2: Start Kafka consumer + anomaly detection
     ```bash 
     cd kafka_streaming_model/consumer
     python detect_anomalies.py
     ```
